# Students review guideline

## How to use statuses

1. When you send your homework, the status **"s - st review"** is assigned to it automatically, you don't need to set it by yourself. 
2. Only if you've done your homework, you can review the other student's homework. Set the status **“o - on st review”** at the review's beginning.
3. After student's review, you received the status **“0 - reject”** (it’s assigned automatically after rejecting on the GitHub). You have to fix your work, and then set the status **“a - again st review”**.
4. After student's review, you received the status **“r - mentor review”** (it’s assigned automatically after approval on the GitHub). You just wait for the mentor review.
5. After mentor’s review, you received the status **“0 - reject”** (it’s assigned automatically after rejecting on the GitHub). You have to fix your work, and then set the status **“r - mentor review”**.
6. After mentor’s review, you received the status **“1 - mt approved”** (it’s assigned automatically after approval on the GitHub). That means your homework is accepted.
